MICRO-GOAL SYSTEM (SEASON 1 – CANON)

Micro-goals are small, ongoing objectives that:

run quietly in the background

influence dialogue, opportunities, and outcomes

make Lala feel like a real person juggling life


They are not quests the audience sees as “tasks”. They are life pressures.

We’ll keep this very simple.


---

🔁 THE 3 MICRO-GOAL CATEGORIES

Lala always has three active lanes:

1️⃣ PERSONAL

2️⃣ FRIENDSHIPS

3️⃣ CAREER / MONEY

Each episode usually touches 1–2, not all three.


---

1️⃣ PERSONAL MICRO-GOALS (IDENTITY + EMOTIONS)

These are about how Lala feels about herself.

Examples

Feel confident without overspending

Enjoy events without turning everything into content

Not feel embarrassed about being broke

Learn balance between “cute” and “practical”


How they show up (important)

Inner dialogue

Tone changes

Small reactions

Hesitation

Overconfidence


Example in an episode

Lala takes photos, then pauses

“Why do I feel weird about this?”



✅ No popup
✅ No reward screen
✅ Just behavior


---

2️⃣ FRIENDSHIP MICRO-GOALS (SOCIAL PRESSURE)

These are about maintaining relationships while changing.

Examples

Don’t annoy friends with content

Don’t rely on friends to pay

Show up on time

Be present


How they show up

Eye rolls

Side comments

Jokes that sting a little

Invitations slowing down

Friends calling her out


Example

Friend says:

“You always look good… but you’re always late.”




That line alone advances the micro-goal.


---

3️⃣ CAREER / MONEY MICRO-GOALS (SURVIVAL MODE)

These are about keeping Lala afloat.

Examples

End episode with more coins than started

Spend less than last episode

Accept at least one opportunity

Don’t miss a deadline

Make one new contact


How they show up

Coin counter tension

Cash-grab prompts

Brand messages

Exposure vs pay conversations


Example

You say:

“Besties… this outfit is cute but we’re broke.”




That’s a career micro-goal moment.


---

🧠 HOW MICRO-GOALS WORK TOGETHER (IMPORTANT)

Micro-goals conflict.

That’s where drama comes from.

Example Conflict

PERSONAL: “I want to enjoy the moment”

FRIENDSHIP: “Stop taking photos”

CAREER: “Post this for exposure”


Lala cannot win all three.

That’s adult storytelling.


---

🎬 MICRO-GOALS INSIDE A SINGLE EPISODE (EXAMPLE)

Episode: Parisian Tea Party

Personal:
“Do I belong here?”

Friendship:
Friend annoyed by photos

Career:
Maison Belle watching


One event. Three pressures.


---

🧩 HOW YOU (THE HOST) INTERACT WITH MICRO-GOALS

You do NOT say:

“Lala failed her friendship goal.”




You say:

“That was awkward…”




The system is invisible. The feeling is real.


---

🔒 RULES (LOCK THESE IN)

No episode explicitly names “micro-goals”

No scorecards for personal or friendship

Career goals can affect coins

Failure is allowed and expected

Growth is gradual



---

✅ WE ARE DONE WITH STEP 1

You now have:

A clean micro-goal framework

No complexity overload

A system that supports long-term storytelling

👯‍♀️ FRIEND ARCHETYPES — SEASON 1 (CANON)

Lala does not have many friends on screen at once.
She has 3–5 recurring archetypes that rotate.

Each friend:

serves a purpose

pushes a different pressure

never feels like a villain



---

⭐ THE 5 CORE FRIEND ARCHETYPES

You do not need all 5 in every episode.


---

1️⃣ THE BELIEVER

(“You should really do this.”)

Sees Lala’s potential early

Encourages influencing

(“Can you just be here?”)

Role in the Story

When Lala is about to mess up



---

4️⃣ THE MIRROR

(“You’re acting different.”)

---

5️⃣ THE CHAOTIC FRIEND

(“This is fun, but also messy.”)

Role in the Story

Makes bad ideas sound fun


Typical Lines

“Do it.”

“Post it.”
“That’s iconic.”



What They Trigger

Messy moments

Regret later

Funny but costly situations


When to Use Them

Parties

Late nights

Emotional episodes

Cliffhanger setups



---

🎭 IMPORTANT RULE: FRIENDS DON’T REPEAT ROLES

Each friend:

sticks to their archetype

evolves slowly

does NOT suddenly switch personalities


That’s how they feel real.


---

🎬 EXAMPLE: ONE EVENT, MULTIPLE FRIENDS

At a dinner:

Believer: “Post this.”

Grounder: “Please don’t.”

Chaotic Friend: “I’d post the bread.”


Lala is stuck in the middle.

That’s the show.


---

🧠 HOW YOU (THE HOST) INTERACT WITH FRIENDS

You:

React

Laugh

Pause

Say “oh no”

Talk to chat


You do not argue with friends directly.
You let Lala experience it.


---

🔒 LOCKED RULES (WRITE THESE DOWN)

Friends create pressure, not answers

No friend is always right

Discomfort = growth

Friends rotate naturally

Silence is sometimes louder than dialogue

👗 OUTFIT STATE RULES (CANON SYSTEM)

Every single clothing item Lala wears exists in one of three states.

These states are about clarity, not restriction.


---

⭐ THE 3 OUTFIT STATES (FINAL)

🟢 1. OWNED

(Lala already has it)

What this means

You bought it in real life

Or it’s canon that Lala already owns it

No obligation attached


How it behaves

Can be worn anytime

No brand mentions required

No posting pressure

Safe, comfortable choice


Story energy

Casual

Confident

Everyday cute

“This is just my style”


Example moments

“This is one of my favorite dresses.”

“I already had this.”




---

🎁 2. GIFTED

(Sent without obligation)

What this means

Brand or friend sent it

No guaranteed payment

No strict posting rules


How it behaves

Optional mention

Optional post

Creates soft pressure

Can be ignored (with consequences)


Story energy

Gratitude

Mild anxiety

Social obligation


Example moments

“They didn’t say I had to post… but it would be nice.”

“I should probably wear it at least once.”




---

🔵 3. BRAND-PROMOTED

(Paid or contracted)

What this means

Coins attached

Clear expectations

Timeline matters


How it behaves

Posting is required

Missing deadlines causes fallout

Performance matters

Can stall or fail


Story energy

Pressure

Stakes

Risk vs reward


Example moments

“This is a paid look.”

“We can’t mess this up.”




---

🧠 WHY THIS SYSTEM IS PERFECT FOR YOU

You said something very important earlier:

“I buy my own outfits — I just need to know what’s being promoted.”




This system does exactly that.

You never feel fake

You never have to over-label

You always know what matters



---

🎬 HOW OUTFIT STATES SHOW UP ON SCREEN

Very subtle. Never loud.

Options:

Small icon

Tiny tag

Color ring

Mentioned once verbally


Example

“This is an owned look.”

“This purse was gifted.”
“This dress is brand-promoted, so we gotta be on time.”



That’s it.


---

💥 CONSEQUENCES (VERY IMPORTANT)

OWNED

No penalties

No rewards

Emotional safety



---

GIFTED

Ignore too often → brand stops sending items

Wear once → goodwill

Post → small bonus



---

BRAND-PROMOTED

Perform well → more deals

Perform poorly → deals stall

Miss deadlines → reputation hit

Overdo → audience fatigue


Just like real life.


---

🧩 OUTFIT STATES + MICRO-GOALS (TOGETHER)

This is where it gets powerful.

Example:

Personal: “I just want to enjoy this.”

Friendship: “Stop taking photos.”

Career: “This is brand-promoted.”


No perfect answer. Just choices.


---

🔒 LOCKED RULES (FINAL)

Every item has ONE state

State does not change mid-episode

Owned items are always safe

Gifted items create pressure, not obligation

Brand-promoted items carry risk

Failure is allowed

Growth is slow



---

✅ STEP 3 COMPLETE

You now have:

Micro-goals

Friend archetypes

Outfit state rules
