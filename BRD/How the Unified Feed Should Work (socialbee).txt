How the Unified Feed Should Work (Conceptually)
Think of it as:

TikTok feed × Creator dashboard × Inbox-lite

🧩 LAYER 1 — Core Timeline (Default View)
✅ YES: Timeline-style feed (LOCK THIS)

Vertical scroll

Mixed platforms

Feels familiar (TikTok/IG energy)

Visual-first

Each feed card shows:

Platform icon + account name

Content preview (image/video thumbnail)

Caption (collapsed → expand)

Engagement summary:

❤️ Likes

💬 Comments count

🔁 Shares

👁 Views (if available)

Status badge:

Posted

Scheduled

Draft

Timestamp

👉 This gives immediate “social dopamine”
👉 Fans feel at home
👉 Besties feel powerful

🧩 LAYER 2 — Engagement Peek (Inline, not overwhelming)
🔒 DO NOT show full comments by default

Instead:

Each post card has:

“View Buzz (12)” button

Or expandable bottom drawer

When expanded:

Top 3–5 comments/replies

Reply box (if allowed by API)

“Open full thread” → side panel

This keeps:

Feed clean

Performance fast

Brain uncluttered

🧩 LAYER 3 — Buzz Panel (Right Column / Slide-in)
🔒 Engagement lives here (not inside the feed)

Buzz Panel shows:

Latest comments

Mentions

Replies needing response

Emoji reactions

DMs (where allowed)

This gives you:

Inbox zero vibes

Clear separation between scrolling and responding

🧩 LAYER 4 — Platform Fidelity (VERY IMPORTANT)

You should NOT fake platform UX completely.

Instead:

TikTok posts still feel like TikTok

IG posts feel like IG

Pinterest feels grid-like when filtered

How:

Platform-specific micro-layouts

Native iconography

Aspect ratios preserved

But:

Interaction model stays unified

🚫 What NOT to Do (Avoid These Traps)

❌ Do NOT dump all comments under every post
❌ Do NOT try to recreate full TikTok app 1:1
❌ Do NOT mix inbox + feed fully
❌ Do NOT force users into tabs for every interaction

This is where most “all-in-one social tools” fail.

Automation triggers

🧭 Default View Recommendation (LOCK THIS)

When a user opens SocialBee:

[ Sidebar ]
- Hive Feed (active)
- Create
- Buzz
- Calendar
- Analytics (locked if needed)

[ Main ]
- Timeline feed (scrollable)

[ Right Panel ]
- Buzz preview
- Platform filters
- Account switcher


This immediately communicates:

“This is social media — but smarter.”

🧠 UX Copy (use this language)

Hive Feed → “Everything you’ve posted, everywhere”

Buzz → “What people are saying”

Honey → “Your content”

Stings → “Needs attention”

Scene → “What’s trending & why”

🧪 MVP Recommendation (so you don’t overbuild)
MVP v1 Feed Includes:

✅ Timeline of posts
✅ Engagement counts
✅ Expandable comments preview
🚫 No DMs yet
🚫 No advanced threading

You can fake depth visually while APIs catch up.
