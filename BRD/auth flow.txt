I’ll lay it out as:

What identities/roles you actually have

The recommended sign-up / login flow

How upgrades work (Fan → Bestie → Creator)

How Creator Portal + Collab access should authenticate (SSO)

The exact screens/routes you’ll want

A few “gotchas” to avoid

1) Core Identity Model (keep it simple)

One account. Many roles.

User Account (single identity)

Role(s) assigned to that account:

Fan

Bestie

Creator (Starter / Plus / Pro)

Collaborator (scoped access)

Admin

Prime Studios (internal)

A user can have multiple roles. Example:

Bestie + Creator

Creator + Collaborator

Admin + Prime Studios

Rule: Roles control feature access, not separate accounts.

2) Recommended Auth Flow (User Facing)
A) Entry (Unauthenticated)

Landing / Welcome

Options:

Continue as Guest (optional)

Sign up

Log in

If you allow guest mode:

Guest can play a tiny demo but can’t earn Prime Coins or save anything.

B) Sign Up

Choose sign-up method:

Email + password

Apple

Google

Minimum info at signup:

Display name (can be changed)

Birth confirmation: “18+” (since you have adult themes)

Accept Terms + Privacy

Then drop them into:

✅ Role selection screen (important)

“How do you want to use Lalaverse today?”

Fan (Free)

Bestie (Paid)

Creator (Paid – Business tools)

If they pick Fan: create Fan role, send to Fan Home
If they pick Bestie: take payment → then Bestie onboarding
If they pick Creator: explain Creator Portal is separate experience → payment → Creator onboarding

Key UX note: Most people won’t understand “Creator Portal is separate” unless you tell them here.

3) Tier Upgrades & Payments (Fan → Bestie → Creator)

Upgrades should be within the same account, no re-signups.

Fan → Bestie

CTA appears in-app

When user subscribes:

add role: bestie=true

unlock Bestie pages instantly

preserve profile + coins

Bestie → Creator

show fairness perks:

convert a portion of Prime Bank to Creator Credits

keep closet items + progress

after payment:

add creator tier role:

creator_tier=starter|plus|pro

Creator Portal becomes available (same login)

✅ Best practice: Creator Portal can be a separate domain/app, but should use SSO so it feels seamless.

4) Creator Portal + Collab Portal Authentication (SSO)

You want:

Lalaverse app

Creator Portal (business)

Collaboration portal access

Internal Studio tools

All under one identity.

Recommended:

One auth provider + one token system (JWT/OAuth)

Use:

Access token (short lived)

Refresh token (secure, httpOnly cookie if web)

Creator Portal login experience:

If user is logged into Lalaverse:

“Open Creator Portal” button → SSO redirect → auto logged in

If not logged in:

Creator Portal login page → login → checks role

If no creator role:

show paywall or “apply” screen

Collaborator Access:

Collaborators are often invited.
Use magic link invites + forced account creation if they don’t exist.

Flow:

Invite email → “Accept Collab”

If user has account → verify login

If not → create account → assign collaborator role scoped to that collab package

Land on Collab Dashboard

5) Auth Screens You Should Have (Clean IA)
Common screens

/welcome

/signup

/login

/verify-email (if using email verification)

/forgot-password

/reset-password

Post-login routing (role-based)

/app (main Lalaverse)

/creator (Creator Portal)

/collab (Collaborator portal)

/admin (Admin console)

/studio (Prime Studios console)

Tier selection (very helpful)

/choose-your-path
Fan | Bestie | Creator

Paywall flows

/upgrade/bestie

/upgrade/creator

6) Role-Based Routing Logic (codable rules)

On login, backend returns:

user profile

roles

tier status

entitlements

Then route:

If user has admin → allow /admin

If user has prime_studios → allow /studio

If user has creator_tier → allow /creator

If user has collaborator → allow /collab

Everyone → allow /app

If they try to access a page without role:

show:

“You don’t have access”

“Upgrade” or “Request invite” CTA

7) Security + Policy Must-Haves (since your content is 18+)

Age gate: 18+ confirmation required at signup

Session/device management

2FA optional (Creator, Admin, Prime Studios recommended)

Rate limit login endpoints

Audit logs for Admin + Studio actions

8) Gotchas to Avoid

❌ Separate accounts for Creator Portal (causes confusion and lost users)

❌ Unlimited roles without clear entitlements (be explicit)

❌ No “Choose your path” screen (people won’t understand what they’re joining)

❌ Letting collaborators wander into lore/game pages (keep scoped)
