THE PRIME CONTROL DESK

Single Source of Truth for the LalaVerse

The Prime Control Desk answers only four questions, always:

1. What’s active?


2. Who decides?


3. What happens when pressure increases?


4. Where does money enter — and where does it stop?



Everything routes through this.

2. DECISION FLOW (THIS IS THE MAGIC)

Here’s how decisions actually move so you don’t have to carry them:

Signal appears
   ↓
System evaluates (capacity, safety, story, money)
   ↓
Options are generated (pause / reuse / delay / hide / fictionalize)
   ↓
Prime Studios approves or denies
   ↓
Admin executes

You are never the bottleneck. You are the final guardian.

3. WHAT THE PRIME CONTROL DESK PROTECTS YOU FROM

Emotional monetization

Over-sharing under pressure

Scope creep

Audience entitlement

Financial exposure

Burnout disguised as momentum


And most importantly:

You never have to decide everything in real time.
