🧩 CORE FEATURE SET
1️⃣ Master Profile (The Source of Truth)

Inside SocialBee, every user has a Master Profile.

Master Profile includes:

Profile photo

Display name

Username

Bio / description

Brand colors (optional)

Default thumbnails

Link-in-bio style links

This profile:

Lives inside LaLaVerse / SocialBee

Acts as the canonical identity

2️⃣ Platform Mapping (Per Account Control)

Each connected platform:

Instagram

TikTok

Pinterest

X

YouTube

etc.

Has a mapping layer.

Example:
Field	SocialBee Master	Instagram	TikTok
Profile photo	✅	Sync ON	Sync OFF
Bio	✅	Sync ON	Sync ON
Display name	✅	Sync OFF	Sync ON
Link	✅	Sync ON	Sync ON

Users choose per platform.

This avoids fear and builds trust.

3️⃣ Visual Preview Before Sync (Critical)

Before pushing updates:

“Here’s how your profile will look on Instagram / TikTok.”

Side-by-side preview

Warnings for:

Character limits

Cropping differences

Unsupported fields

This instantly makes SocialBee feel professional, not risky.

4️⃣ Thumbnail & Visual Style Sync
YES — thumbnails too 🔥

Users can:

Upload default thumbnail styles

Choose:

Square

Vertical

Horizontal

Add:

Title text

Brand color overlay

Emoji accent

Save presets

Or offers “Use brand thumbnail” toggle per post

This is brand recognition at scale.

🧠 Why This Is a Brand Identity Game-Changer

“The place where your online identity lives.”

Not just a posting tool.
A brand OS.

🔐 Safety & API Reality Check (Important)

Some platforms:

Limit profile updates

Rate-limit changes

Don’t allow full automation

Solution:

Graceful fallbacks

Manual copy buttons

“Copy bio” / “Download thumbnail”

Even partial sync is valuable.
