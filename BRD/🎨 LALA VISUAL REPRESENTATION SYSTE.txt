🎨 LALA VISUAL REPRESENTATION SYSTEM (V1)

Including Styling Adventures Game

This defines how Lala looks, where she appears, and how she changes across the platform.

1️⃣ CORE VISUAL PRINCIPLE (Very Important)

Lala has ONE identity, shown in DIFFERENT visual modes depending on context.

Think of her like a real person:

You see her full outfit when fashion matters

You see her face/bust when conversation or guidance matters

2️⃣ VISUAL MODES (LOCK THESE IN)

Lala has 4 official visual modes.
Every page uses one of these only.

Side panels: Outfit, hair, makeup options

👗 HOW OUTFITS WORK (BEGINNER SAFE)

You are NOT building a live avatar builder.

Instead:

Lala uses Look Presets

Each Look Preset = a saved visual asset

Hair: long waves, brown

Nails: neutral almond

Pose: relaxed

Mood: Soft

Scene: Rooftop sunset

Changing outfits = switching presets.
