First Rule: Set a “Daily Average Earning Rate”

Before pricing anything, decide:

How many coins should an average fan earn per day?

Recommended for engagement:

👉 5–10 LC/day for an active participant

(through watching, chat, trivia, streaks, etc.)

This becomes the anchor for pricing.

🌟 2. Use the 10x Rule for Prize Pricing

A good economy uses a 10x multiplier:

Fans should need 10 days of engagement to reach Tier 1 rewards
20–30 days for mid-tier
60–90 days for big prizes

This makes rewards feel valuable and increases retention.

🌟 3. Recommended Pricing Tiers
⭐ Tier 1: Small Rewards (should take 7–14 days)

These are fun, low-stakes rewards that keep fans hooked.

Examples:

Coffee Raffle Entry (Bestie Coffee: You + Me)
Price: 50 LC

Why 50?

Fans earning ~5–10 LC/day will need 5–10 days → perfect difficulty.

Other Tier 1:

Digital badges → 25 LC

Shoutout on stream → 30 LC

⭐ Tier 2: Medium Rewards (20–40 days)

These should feel like real achievements.

Merch discount coupon → 200 LC

Personal voice memo → 150 LC

Exclusive BTS video → 100 LC

Early access to a big announcement → 100 LC

⭐ Tier 3: High-Value Rewards (60–90+ days)

These should feel elite and keep big fans grinding.

“La’s Land Box” → 350–400 LC

Virtual hangout → 500 LC

$250 prize → 250 LC entry + must win the raffle

“Super Bestie Badge” → 300 LC

These take effort but are reachable for dedicated fans.

🌟 4. How to Make Coins Harder to Get (the Secret Sauce)

If you want fans to REALLY work for coins:

🔥 A. Cap the maximum daily earnings

Example:

Daily max = 10 LC

Weekly max = 60 LC

Keeps the system fair and prevents whales from breaking it.

🔥 B. Add conditions

Instead of giving coins for everything, require tasks:

Examples:

Chatting only earns coins if you send meaningful messages

Trivia only counts if you get 3 correct questions

Watch-time coins only unlock after watching 5 minutes

Streak bonuses require consecutive days

This makes coins feel earned instead of given.

🔥 C. Use “quest missions” as the main coin source

This makes fans work intentionally.

Examples:

Weekly “Bestie Challenge”: 15 LC

Share the stream: 10 LC

Show up to 3 streams: 10 LC

Bring a friend: 20 LC

Fans LOVE goals.

🔥 D. Limit big coin drops to special events

Only do:

Double Coin Weekend

Monthly Bestie Bonus

Birthday coin drop

Seasonal events

If big drops are frequent → inflation kills the economy.

🌟 5. Visualizing the Effort Required

Here’s how long fans must grind:

Reward	Price	Days Needed	Effort Level
Coffee Raffle	50 LC	5–10 days	⭐ Easy/Medium
BTS Video	100 LC	10–20 days	⭐⭐ Medium
Merch Discount	200 LC	20–40 days	⭐⭐⭐ Medium/Hard
Super Bestie Badge	300 LC	30–60 days	⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard
Hangout	500 LC	50–100 days	🌟🌟 Elite

This pacing is PERFECT for a show.

🌟 6. The Secret to Making Fans Want to Work Hard?

You anchor everything with progress bars + milestones.

Examples:

“You're 35% of the way to your Bestie Coffee!”

“Earn 15 LC more to unlock your first raffle!”

“Only 2 badges away from Elite Bestie!”

People LOVE watching a bar fill.
