WHY 24 EPISODES MAKES SENSE FOR STYLING ADVENTURES WITH LALA

1️⃣ It Feels Like Real TV (Adult Audience)

Reality TV + lifestyle shows often run 20–24 episodes

Your audience is adults → they’re used to longer arcs

It gives room for:

Fashion evolution

Relationship drama

Career ups and downs

2️⃣ It Supports Your GAME + QUEST SYSTEM

With 24 episodes you can:

Slowly progress Personal / Relationship / Career lanes

Introduce cash-grabs naturally

3️⃣ It’s Perfect for Brands

Brands LOVE:

Guaranteed episode volume

Predictable drops

You can confidently say:

“Each season includes 24 episodes with multiple shoppable moments.”




That’s very pitchable.

✔ Plan arcs in blocks of 6

This is not too much.
This is franchise pacing.
