🔒 LOCKED PRODUCT DECISIONS FOR SOCIALBEE™
1️⃣ Color Scheme — LOCK THIS
✅ Use Styling Adventures brand colors

NOT gold/black/yellow bee colors.

Why (important):

Your brand is already distinctive (soft pink → hot pink → purple).

Bee/yellow would feel like a separate SaaS, not part of LaLaVerse.

Bee imagery works best as metaphor + accents, not palette takeover.

🎨 Final Color Strategy

Use bee concepts, not bee colors.

Primary UI palette

#ffe4f3 → background washes, cards

#f9a8d4 → surfaces, hover states

#ec4899 → CTAs, active states

#a855f7 → highlights, progress, premium features

Bee accents

Small honey dots

Hex outlines

Subtle hex grid backgrounds at low opacity

Microcopy (“Buzz”, “Hive”, “Honey”)

🚫 No yellow UI.
🚫 No black-heavy dashboards.

2️⃣ Icon Style — HYBRID (LOCKED)
✅ Platform icons stay platform-authentic

(TikTok logo, IG logo, Pinterest, etc.)

✅ Bee accents for system actions

Hive Feed icon → hex / layered cards

Buzz Inbox → notification bubble

Honey (content) → sparkle / drop icon

Automations → subtle hex/gear combo

Rule

Content = platform icon

System = bee-inspired abstraction

This avoids confusion and keeps trust high.

3️⃣ Layout Preference — RESPONSIVE 3-COLUMN (LOCKED)
Desktop / Tablet
[ Sidebar ] [ Hive Feed / Composer ] [ Context Panel ]

Mobile
Top tabs:
Hive | Create | Inbox | Me


Why

Social tools are inherently multi-pane

Your users are creators → desktop-heavy

Mobile still works, but not mobile-only

🚫 Do NOT build mobile-first only
🚫 Do NOT hide features behind too many taps

🚀 MVP SCOPE (REALISTIC + STRATEGIC)
Platforms for MVP — LOCKED

Start with 2 platforms, not 3.

🥇 Phase 1

Instagram

TikTok

Why:

Your audience lives there

Strong visual overlap with Styling Adventures

Clear upgrade incentive

🥈 Phase 2

Pinterest (perfect for fashion + closet)

YouTube Shorts

🚫 Skip Twitter/X at launch (less aligned with fashion/visual DNA)

Core Feature Priority — LOCKED MVP ORDER
MVP v1 (Launchable, safe, fast)

✅ Connect accounts
✅ Unified feed view (Hive Feed)
✅ Draft composer
✅ Manual export (“Copy caption / Download asset”)
✅ Tier gating visible but not frustrating

🚫 No auto-publishing yet

MVP v1.5

✅ API posting for 1 platform (Instagram or TikTok)
✅ Scheduling (internal calendar)
✅ Basic analytics (likes, views, saves)

MVP v2

✅ Crossposting rules
✅ Inbox
✅ Automations (The Scene™)

🧠 DATA & ARCHITECTURE — HYBRID (LOCKED)
✅ Hybrid approach (best decision)

Mock data for UI now

Real API hooks designed but not enforced

Why

You can ship UI immediately

You can demo to users/investors

You avoid platform approval hell early

Account Storage (recommended)

DB table: connected_accounts

user_id

platform

account_name

scope

connection_level (view / publish / assisted)

Tokens:

Stored encrypted

AWS Secrets Manager (yes, later)

Stub now

Tier-Based Access — VERY IMPORTANT DECISION
🔒 Decision: SocialBee is INCLUDED in Bestie

But…

Add SocialBee Pro as:

Tier 3

Or add-on upgrade

Access model
Tier	SocialBee Access
Fan	View-only (Hive Feed preview)
Bestie	Create + Drafts + Manual export
Scene / Pro	API posting, scheduling, analytics, automations

This avoids:

Feature overload for Fans

Confusing pricing

Cannibalizing Bestie value

📱 Mobile — Responsive First (LOCKED)

Must work on phone

Optimized for tablet + desktop

Mobile = consumption + quick actions

Desktop = creation + scheduling

Think:

“Check on phone, create on desktop.”
